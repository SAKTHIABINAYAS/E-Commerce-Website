# E-Commerce-Website
Creating an e-commerce website using the full stack development echnologies involves several steps, including setting up the front-end and back-end, integrating databases, and ensuring a seamless user experience.
# STEP-1: Choose your Technology Stack
For a full stack e-commerce application, a popular stack is the MERN stack, which includes:
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for data storage.
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js.
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for server-side development.

# STEP-2: Set up Your Development Environment
# 1.Install Required Software:
*Download and install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) from the official website.
*Install MongoDB to handle your database needs.
# 2.Initialize Your Project:
* Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:
```
mkdir ecommerce-app
cd ecommerce-app
```
* Initialize a new Node.js project:
```
npm init -y
```
# STEP-3: Set Up the Back-End:
# 1. Install Necessary Packages:
```
npm install express mongoose dotenv bcryptjs jsonwebtoken
```
# 2. Create Project Structure:
Organize your project with folders for routes, models, and controllers. A simple structure may look like this:
```
ecommerce-app/
├── backend/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── routes/
│   ├── controllers/
│   └── server.js
└── frontend/
```
# 3. Develop the Server:
In server.js, set up your Express server and connect to MongoDB:
```
const express = require('express');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const dotenv = require('dotenv');

dotenv.config();
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
    .then(() => console.log("MongoDB connected"))
    .catch(err => console.log(err));

app.listen(5000, () => {
    console.log("Server is running on port 5000");
});
```
# STEP-4: Set Up the Front-End
# 1. Create a React Application:
Use Create React App to set up your front-end:
```
npx create-react-app frontend
cd frontend
```
# 2. Build Components:
Create components for your application, such as Header, ProductList, and Cart. For example, a simple header component could look like this:
```
// src/components/Header.js
import React from 'react';

const Header = () => {
    return (
        <header>
            <h1>E-Commerce App</h1>
            {/* Add navigation and other components as needed */}
        </header>
    );
};

export default Header;
```
# 3. Integrate with Backend:
Use Axios or Fetch API to connect your front-end with the back-end. For example, you can retrieve products from your API and display them in your ProductList component.
